                Our plan - she would go to law school and I would find work as a software developer. 
                Along the way, we had two children together, are fortunate to have thriving careers, 
                and I canâ€™t imagine living anywhere else.

                For the last 8 years, I have been writing software for Fidelity Investments in Smithfield, 
                RI. I tackle data analysis, automating as much of my job as possible, and agile team building. 
                My employer encourages volunteerism, and two years ago I took advantage of that workplace norm to 
                start an after-school coding club at KMS. The intellectual curiosity of middle schoolers 
                is awe-inspiring. Our club started with a motley assortment of coding equipment and now, 
                through a private grant, has grown to includea a group of 8-10 students using a language called
                Python to control Minecraft worlds on small computers called Raspberry Pis 
                (<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi" target="_blank">try it out!</a>).

                My decision to run for School Committee stems in part from this experience. I worked with 
                incredibly dedicated BWRSD teachers and administrators, but also noticed resource 
                shortages. The pandemic has only exposed further the digital disparities children and 
                educators experienced during distance learning.

                I want the opportunity to be more actively involved in the decision-making for the children 
                in our community. I want to see safe school environments that promote diverse and inclusive 
                educational opportunities. We will need level-headed analysis in the coming year and beyond, 
                and I believe I am uniquely positioned to deliver it.
